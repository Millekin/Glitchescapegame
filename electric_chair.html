      We died... You fell on their fake website, their hackerproof method, it alerted them that someone was hacking to liberate some prisoners and even though they didn't know of your existence, they knew that we, the most reknowned hackers, wouldn't be stopped that easily. They decided to execute on the spot with the electric chair in total secret. Your mistake killed us all.
